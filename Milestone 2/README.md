# Milestone 2 - Interactive Graphics and Animation

## Overview
Milestone 2 delves into interactive graphics and animation using Python. This phase builds upon the foundational graphics concepts from Milestone 1 and introduces interactivity, object-oriented design, and animation timing.

## Key Concepts
- Object-Oriented Programming: Utilizing classes to encapsulate the properties and behaviors of graphical objects.
- Animation: Implementing timers to create continuous and dynamic visual changes.
- Event Handling: Responding to user inputs like mouse clicks to influence the animation.

## Included Files
- `circles.py`: Manages an animation of balls moving and shrinking on a canvas.
- `click.py`: Handles user interactions with the canvas to affect the objects drawn.

## Running the Programs
You will need Python and the appropriate graphics library installed. To run any script:
`python <script_name>.py`
Replace <script_name> with the script you want to execute.
