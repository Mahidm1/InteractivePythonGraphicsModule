# Milestone 1 - Fundamental Graphics Programming

## Overview
Milestone 1 introduces basic graphics programming in Python. Through a series of scripts, the concepts of drawing on a canvas, manipulating shapes, and responding to time-based events are explored.

## Scripts and Learning Outcomes
- `canvas.py`: Introduces the canvas where graphical objects can be drawn. It cycles the canvas background color to demonstrate dynamic updates.
- `circles.py`: Focuses on drawing circles with randomly generated colors, illustrating shape rendering and color manipulation.
- `lines.py`: Demonstrates the drawing of lines, highlighting coordinate system usage and the properties of lines.
- `points.py`: Renders points on the canvas, showcasing how individual pixels can be manipulated on the screen.
- `shrink_expand.py`: Interactively toggles the size of a circle between shrinking and expanding, teaching the basics of animation and user input handling.

## How to Run
Ensure Python is installed and execute each script with the command:
`python <script_name>.py`
Replace <script_name> with the name of the script you want to run.
