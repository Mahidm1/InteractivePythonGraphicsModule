# Milestone 3 - User Interactions and Event-Driven Programming

## Overview
Milestone 3 introduces event-driven programming by incorporating user input to influence graphical elements. This module focuses on understanding how user actions can control objects within a graphical interface, using Python.

## Key Concepts
- Event-Driven Programming: Capturing and responding to user events such as key presses.
- Object-Oriented Design: Enhancing the `Wheel` class with interactive behaviors.
- User Input Handling: Using the `Keyboard` class to trigger movements in the `Wheel` object.

## Files
- `wheel.py`: The main script that includes the `Wheel`, `Keyboard`, and `Interaction` classes to demonstrate a simple interaction where user input affects a wheel's movement on the canvas.

## Running the Script
To experience the interaction, make sure you have Python installed along with the required graphical library, and run the script:
`python wheel.py`
Interact with the wheel using the left and right arrow keys.
