# Programming Module - Interactive Python Graphics

## Module Overview
This repository is a collection of milestone projects from an Object-Oriented Programming module that focuses on interactive graphics programming in Python. Each milestone is designed to progressively introduce more complex concepts, building from basic graphics to advanced animations and interactions.

## Milestones Summary
- **Milestone 1**: Lays the foundation with basic graphics rendering, covering canvas operations, and simple shape drawing.
- **Milestone 2**: Introduces interactivity, allowing users to engage with graphical elements and manipulate them in real-time.
- **Milestone 3**: Delves into event-driven programming, connecting user inputs to graphical responses, emphasizing the power of interaction in graphics programming.
- **Milestone 4**: Explores advanced graphics techniques like sprite sheet animations, demonstrating how to create rich, dynamic visual effects.

## Learning Path
Each milestone folder contains a `README.md` that details the specific concepts covered, files included, and instructions to run the examples. The progression through these milestones will equip you with a solid understanding of Python's capabilities for creating interactive graphics and animations.

## Running the Projects
To run any of the projects, navigate to the milestone's directory and execute the Python scripts as described in the respective `README.md` files.
