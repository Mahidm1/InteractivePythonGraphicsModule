# Milestone 4 - Advanced Graphics and Animation with Sprite Sheets

## Overview
Milestone 4 explores advanced graphics programming in Python, focusing on animation techniques using sprite sheets. This milestone teaches how to manage complex animations and interact with graphical objects dynamically.

## Key Concepts
- Sprite Sheet Animation: Learning how to use a sprite sheet to create smooth animations.
- Timing and Transitions: Using a custom `Clock` class to handle frame transitions.
- Event Handling: Managing user input and events to trigger changes in the animation.

## Included Files
- `spritesheet.py`: Implements a `Spritesheet` class that cycles through a series of images to create an animation.
- `explosions.py`: Handles animations for explosions, likely using sprite sheets to visualize each stage of the explosion.

## Running the Scripts
To run the scripts, Python and the necessary graphics library should be installed. Execute the script using the following command:
`python <script_name>.py`
Replace <script_name> with either spritesheet or explosions to see the respective animations.
